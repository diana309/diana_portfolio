            <p>Sift is an educational waste management mobile application that helps users make informed recycling decisions by locating convenient recycling centers, filtering search functions, and allowing for further education with an object scanning feature. The application clearly explains which items go into which bins. Since the project focuses on the Vancouver area, it will comply with the recycling regulations in this area. </p>

As we can not predict how the users will take a picture, there is a <b>camera result not found</b> screen that has some tips on how to take a better picture.</p>

New user profile page shows how the profile page will look for a new user who did not earn any badges and scanned any objects. The Recycling Centres Locations screen uses geolocation to show nearby recycling centers. In cases when the geolocation is not working the user can input their address manually to search for the nearby recycling centre. </p>

            <p>Our team consisted of 7 people and to be more productive, we decided to create a separate plan for developers and designers. I was the project manager and hence in charge of planning the project.  For design plan I worked colsely with a desig lean to plan our weekly sprints.</p>

            <p>We had to keep the development plan not very precise since most of the work would be dependent on the design team. I worked closely with the dev lead to plan and understand what features we will be able to deliver within a given timeframe.</p>

            <p>If our team was to continue with this project in the future we would focus on other steps, such as tracking most scanned items to understand what users find confusing to recycle, expanding the list of recognized materials and trying to collaborate with charities to promote their services in our application. We would also focus on expending available badges and adding some value to them (eg. points that can be used for discounts in environmentally friendly stores) to motivate the users to use the application.</p>

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <p>Overall, I am pleased with the project's outcome. As a project manager, I prepared the meetings to ensure they are efficient and allow each member of the team to share ideas. Sometimes we had different opinions in the design process. To select the best design solution, each designer pitched their idea and the team voted for the strongest presentation. The camera and the search features that I was working on had 3 major iterations due to the constraints from the development team, as not everything that we planned was possible to implement within the given time frame. This experience has taught me why I must be very flexible as a designer and not be afraid to come up with new ideas. </p>

            <h2>What can be improved</h2>
            <p>I believe our team was very successful in working together, meeting all the deadlines on time and clearly communicating with each other. One of the areas where we could improve was spending more time planning our design process. While creating the wireframes, we had four designers working on different features of the application, and unfortunately we did not consider creating components to make it faster and easier. However we learned our lesson and when we were creating high fidelity screens we created all the necessary components which resulted in efficient and consistent designs</p>
