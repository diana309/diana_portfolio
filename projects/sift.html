            <p>Sift is an educational waste management mobile application that helps users make informed recycling decisions by locating convenient recycling centers, filtering search functions, and allowing for further education with an object scanning feature. The application clearly explains which items go into which bins. Since the project focuses on the Vancouver area, it will comply with the recycling regulations in this area. </p>

            <p>People do not know how to recycle their waste correctly, what can be recycled or what to do with it.</p>
            <p>" One of the biggest challenges for recycling programs is dealing with the garbage or other non-recyclable materials that end up in the system." -CBC News</p>
            <p>After conducting secondary research and  a survey our team found out that 70% of people are not sure how to recycle most of their garbage and this is why they put everything in general waste.</p>

            <h2>Illustrations</h2>
            <p>The design team created a set of illustrations and icons for making the recycling instructions more clear and conveying the problem that the application is trying to solve.</p>

        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <p>One of the requirements was to make the app accessible to both Android and IOS users, that's why we built it with React Native. This diagram shows how the application works on the front and the back-end.</p>

        <h2>Promotional Video</h2>
        <p>This is the promotional video that I have created for the promotion and the final presentation of the Sift project. I used illustrator to edit and separate the layers of the illustrations created by the design team. I used Premier Pro to edit the video and adding the sound effects.</p>

        <section class="section_wrapper">
            <p>If our team was to continue with this project in the future we would focus on other steps, such as tracking most scanned items to understand what users find confusing to recycle, expanding the list of recognized materials and trying to collaborate with charities to promote their services in our application. We would also focus on expending available badges and adding some value to them (eg. points that can be used for discounts in environmentally friendly stores) to motivate the users to use the application.</p>

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <p>Overall, I am pleased with the project's outcome. As a project manager, I prepared for meetings meticulously to ensure they are efficient and allow each member of the team time to share their ideas. Sometimes we had different opinions in the design process. To select the best design solution, each designer pitched their idea and the team voted for the strongest presentation. The camera and the search features that I was working on had 3 major iterations due to the constraints from the developers as not everything that we planned was possible to implement within the given time frame. This experience has taught me why I must be very flexible as a designer and not be afraid to come up with new ideas. </p>

            <h2>What can be improved</h2>
            <p>I believe our team was very successful in working together, meeting all the deadlines on time and clearly communicating with each other. One of the areas where we could improve was spending more time planning our design process. While creating the wireframes, we had four designers working on different features of the application, and unfortunately we did not consider creating components to make it faster and easier. However we learned our lesson and when we were creating high fidelity screens we created all the necessary components which resulted in efficient and consistent designs</p>
